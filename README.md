This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Operation

### Getting started

1. In the Dashboard, click **Create Project +**
2. Under **Pick Components**, choose **React + Vite**. Here you can also add a backend framework to create a monorepo app, eg, React+Vite for frontend and Hono for backend
3. In **Pick Add-ons**, you can add one or multiple databases to your app
4. Choose **Create Repository** to generate a new GitHub repo
5. Finally, click **Launch Stack**

### Development

Will run `npm install` when component is first initialized, and `npm run dev` when deployment is started.

### Production

Will build a production ready image. Image runs `npm install` & `npm run build` when being created. The created `/dist` folder will be served as a static site with [nginx](https://nginx.org/).
